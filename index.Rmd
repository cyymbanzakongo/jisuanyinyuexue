### Background of Keyboard Instrument History

Progress in musical style is often accompanied by progress in the instrument itself. Many believe that the improvement of the harpsichord - a keyboard instrument - to the piano has greatly broadened the expressive power of keyboard music. The prevailing view is that the harpsichord cannot be adjusted for volume, has a single tone, and is so low that in modern times there is no longer a place for the harpsichord except in historical performance and in the performance of certain works with special requirements.
To verify this, we have chosen to play the same piece on both instruments separately. We use the Goldberg Variations by J.S. Bach as a corpus.
